# CHAT.CONNOR.FU-
#N

File structure:
```
chat-connor-fun
    -config
    -controllers
    -db
    -frontend
        -css
        -js
        index.html
    -models
    views
    main.go
```

The `frontend` folder will later be packaged into the executable

`index.html` will probably just be a blank html document with the needed 
script tags  

The `views` folder will contain exactly one view which produced the original `index.html`

`main.go` is the entry-point into the server

## Details
`chat.connor.fun` will have a REST api located at `chat.connor.fun/api/v1/`. 
I'll figure out what it will do later. I have no idea how to write Go...
